          Gangotri is one of the origin sources of Holy River Ganga (Ganges),
          and one of the important Char Dham pilgrimage in Hindu Religion. The
          main origin of the river is “Gaumukh” which is a glacier located 19 km
          away from gangotri temple. Ganga river is the longest and most sacred
          river in world. Gangotri is located at an altitude of 3100 meters
          above sea level, on the banks of Bhagirathi river. Gangotri is the
          starting point of Ganga river where the goddess Ganga workshipped by
          the Pilgrims or Devotees. In Ancient time the river is called
          Bhagirathi and attains the name Ganga from Devprayag onwards where
          Bhagirathi meets with Alaknanda form Ganga River. Gangotri is the home
          place of many ashrams, small shrines and temple.

          According to Hindu Mythology, It is said that the Ganga is a result of
          reward given by lord “Shiva” to the king “Bhagirath” for his penance.
          However due to her pride and the fact that the earth would be
          devastated if Ganga came down in her full force, Lord Shiva caught her
          in his locks. The sacred stone near the temple denotes the place where
          Ganga first came down to earth. This is why Ganga is also called by
          the name of Bhagirathi. The Present temple was constructed by a Gorkha
          Commander Amar Singh Thapa in the early 18th Century. It is said that
          at the time of construction of temple Gaumukh Glacier was here but
          receded to it's present location due to global warming.
